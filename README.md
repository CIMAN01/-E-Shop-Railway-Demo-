# **E-Shop App**

- - - -

#### A not-so-simple e-commerce web app built using the MERN stack which lets a user create an account, and shop for products. Once the user logs in, adds item(s) to their cart, and go thru the checkout process using PayPal as a payment method, they are then able to place an order. An admin can also log in and make any other user an admin. As an admin, you can view orders, delete orders, mark an order as shipped, or add or delete any products in the store.  

#### The app's front-end connects to a back-end API (written in Node.js) used to communicate or send data to and from a MongoDB Atlas server.
